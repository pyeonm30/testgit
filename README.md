🛵 **I am Developer skilled in API and WEB.** 👩🏻‍💻 I have a passion for building diverse web applications and services, focusing on delivering excellent user experiences through optimized code and scalable systems. I am particularly interested in database management and API development, constantly learning new technologies and contributing to team goals through collaboration. <br>

I enjoy playing the piano and appreciating works of art.<br>
In my opinion, coding is also an art form. Beutiful!
